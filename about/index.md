My first post was carved out with vi and .html files posted to a geocities site circa 2001. From there, phpnuke, then on to other blogging engines landing on wordpress, and more recently, ghost.  Mostly the content has remained the same. virtualization, storage, brewing, family and travel. 

While I'd love to migrate every post out of wordpress backups, I think I'm going to go ahead and leave most of them as "retired". I've migrated a few posts that still get brought up from time to time, and I plan to start writing more new content here moving forward.  Thanks for swinging by and if there's something that you're looking for specifically that I haven't migrated, just let me know.  Archive.org has some of the content avilable there as well.
